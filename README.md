### Dotfiles

Use these files in your bash to improve it.

Start by cloning this repo into `~/.dotfiles`. Then add this to your
`~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` if you're in a Mac):

`source ~/.dotfiles/bash`

Now run the loading command:

`$ ubp`

`ubp` will **U**pdate **B**ash **P**rofile with whatever is in the .dotfiles
dir.
